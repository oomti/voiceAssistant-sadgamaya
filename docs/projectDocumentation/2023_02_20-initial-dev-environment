## Create a Dev environment

Specifications

Following a [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) specifications for branching strategy

Each branch will have it`s own infrastructure defined.

The developer branch has no infrastructure on it`s own, feature branches get VM-s allocated to run and simulate developer code rapidly.

- Create VM for developer branch
- Once branch is updated push code to VM
- Restart Node Server on VM


Requirements:
 - Store a VM startup script and configuration file
 - store a cloudbuild yaml
 - define access controls to VM
 - configure cloud build to trigger on the git branch

Steps:
 - configure to start a VM for every branch tagged with developer 

VM requirements
- install yarn
- install yarn packages 
- start node
- set up IAP and cloudnat
- use a hardened default image(feature to be added later)
