## Branching strategy

There will be four key stages of deployment, 
developers will have their feature branches and commit to the development branch once a feature is tested and completed.

In the testing version integration tests and other automated tests are ran

Once the testing phase is validated, application is pushed to canary.

User Acceptance testing and exposure to a small number of user is done

Once Canary is accepted push to production
